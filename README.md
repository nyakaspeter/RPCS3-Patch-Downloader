# RPCS3-Patch-Downloader
(Very) simple command line program that fetches RPCS3 community patches and writes them into patch.yml

## Usage
0. Build it yourself or download executable
1. Put executable in RPCS3/patches directory
2. Run executable
3. Congrats, you saved yourself 1-2 minutes of valuable time! All the patches are in patch.yml

## Notes
The program works as of the time of the last release, but a simple change in the RPCS3 community patches page can break it completely.
Hopefully in the future as the RPCS3 patch system gets better, this program will be unnecessary.
